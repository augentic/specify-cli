//! `specify journal emit` — guarded front door onto the closed
//! workflow §Observability event taxonomy.
//!
//! `emit` is the only verb: it deserialises `<event-id>` + `--payload`
//! into the closed [`specify_workflow::journal::EventKind`] (the
//! taxonomy *is* the per-kind payload schema — there is no parallel
//! JSON-schema registry), stamps a second-precision UTC timestamp, and
//! appends exactly one well-formed line to `.specify/journal.jsonl`.
//! The emitter mints no event kinds of its own.
