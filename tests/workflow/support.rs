//! Shared fixtures, seeds, and re-exports for the `workflow`
//! integration suite (REVIEW.md A13).
//!
//! The suite is split across themed submodules grouped by `plan`
//! command family (`validate`, `next`, `mutate`, `source_binding`,
//! `transition`, `create`, `archive`, `propose`, `authority`). Every
//! submodule pulls its shared surface in with `use crate::support::*;`,
//! so the common imports, helpers, and plan seeds live here once.
