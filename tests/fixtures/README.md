## WASI Tool Fixtures

`tools-test-project/` and `tools-test-cap/` hold deterministic RFC-15 acceptance fixtures.
The `.wasm` files are checked in so developer machines and CI do not need to rebuild
WASI components before running `cargo test --workspace`.

To rebuild the blobs, install the target plus `wasm-tools`, then run:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo install wasm-tools
make tools-test-fixtures
```

The Rust source crate lives at `tools-test-project/src-rust/`. `exit-seven.wasm`
is generated from `tools-test-cap/src-wat/exit-seven.component.wat` because the
stable WASI 0.2 Rust bindings expose only success/failure through `std::process`,
while this fixture needs the Preview 2 `exit-with-code` import to assert exit 7.

The checked-in manifests use `file:///__SPECIFY_FIXTURE_ROOT__/...` placeholders
because RFC-15 requires local tool sources to be absolute. Integration tests copy
the fixtures to a tempdir and rewrite those placeholders to the copied fixture root
before invoking `specify`.
