# Omnia Capability

- **URL**: `https://github.com/augentic/specify/capabilities/omnia`
- **Purpose**: Rust WASM development (greenfield or migration)
- **Source**: Git Repository, Source Code, or Manual (all analyzed via `/spec:extract`)
- **Target**: Rust WASM (Omnia SDK)
- **Workflow**: `define` -> `specs` (from Code or Manual) -> `design` -> `tasks` -> `build` (crate-writer)

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `capability.yaml` | Pipeline phases (`define`, `build`, `merge`) and per-phase brief references |
| `briefs/proposal.md` | Generation brief for the proposal stage |
| `briefs/specs.md` | Generation brief for the specs stage |
| `briefs/design.md` | Generation brief for the design stage |
| `briefs/tasks.md` | Generation brief for the tasks stage |
| `briefs/build.md` | Implementation brief for the build stage |
| `briefs/merge.md` | Merge brief for finalizing a slice |

## Pipeline

The capability declares four briefs under `pipeline.define` in dependency order:

1. **proposal** — initial proposal document (`proposal.md`)
2. **specs** — detailed specifications (`specs/**/*.md`), requires proposal
3. **design** — technical design with implementation details (`design.md`), requires proposal
4. **tasks** — implementation checklist (`tasks.md`), requires specs + design

`pipeline.build` requires tasks to be complete and is tracked via `tasks.md`.
`pipeline.merge` finalises the slice and runs the merge brief.

## Capability framework

For general capability concepts — directory structure, field reference for
`capability.yaml`, capability resolution, composition, caching, and rules
override — see the [Capabilities README](../README.md) and the bundled
[`capability.schema.json`](../capability.schema.json).
