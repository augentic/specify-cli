## Agent-Completable Constraint

Generate only tasks that an agent can complete and verify with code or
local tooling. Do not generate manual verification, real-world API,
production credential, visual inspection, or user-confirmation tasks.

When external behavior must be verified, express it as an
agent-verifiable task:

- Use `omnia:test-writer` to add MockProvider, fixture-backed, or
  contract-aligned tests for API and side-effect behavior.
- Use build tasks for `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and
  WASM target builds through the build brief's verify-repair loop.
- Use `omnia:code-reviewer` for post-implementation review instead of
  human review tasks.
