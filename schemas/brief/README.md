# `brief/schema.json`

Canonical JSON Schema (2020-12) for the YAML **frontmatter block** at the top of every brief markdown file under `schemas/*/briefs/**/*.md`. A brief describes one step of a schema's pipeline; the frontmatter declares the step's identity (`id`, `description`) and its graph edges (`needs`, `generates`, `tracks`).

## Shape

Every brief starts with a YAML frontmatter block delimited by `---` lines:

```markdown
---
id: discovery
description: Read inputs and emit a neutral capability inventory.
generates: .specify/plans/<name>/discovery.md
needs: [propose]
---

Free-form markdown body follows.
```

The schema validates the YAML *between* the delimiters. The markdown body is not constrained by this schema.

## Fields

| Field | Required | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | non-empty string | Referenced by `needs` in sibling briefs and by `pipeline.*` entries in the owning `schema.yaml`. |
| `description` | yes | non-empty string | One-sentence summary surfaced when listing pipeline steps. |
| `needs` | no | unique array of strings | Briefs whose outputs this brief consumes. Forms the pipeline DAG. |
| `generates` | no | non-empty string | Output path (optionally glob-shaped) produced by the brief. |
| `tracks` | no | non-empty string | Identifier of an artefact this brief iterates over (e.g. `tasks` for a build brief). Signals per-item progress. |

`additionalProperties` is `false`: unknown keys cause validation to fail. Keeping the frontmatter vocabulary small is the point; every field here is load-bearing for how the pipeline runner schedules briefs.

## Editor integration

VS Code, Zed, Cursor, and any other editor that speaks the [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) protocol can lint brief frontmatter as-you-type by pointing at this schema with a top-of-file modeline:

```markdown
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/augentic/specify-cli/main/schemas/brief/schema.json
---
id: discovery
description: ...
---
```

The comment MUST precede the opening `---` delimiter so the language server sees it before the frontmatter block. Both the `yaml-language-server:` prefix and the raw-content URL form are required by the YAML Language Server convention; see its [schema-association docs](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#using-inlined-schema) for the full syntax.

For offline work, point `$schema` at the checked-in file via a `file://` URL or a workspace-relative path, depending on what your editor's YAML integration accepts.
