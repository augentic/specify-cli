//! Axis-split adapter manifest model and post-load coherence gates.
//!
//! Source adapters and target adapters share a manifest shape on the
//! wire (`adapter.yaml`) but carry disjoint closed operation sets:
//! [`SourceOperation`] (`extract | survey`) vs. [`TargetOperation`]
//! (`shape | build | merge`). The in-memory split into
//! [`SourceAdapter`] / [`TargetAdapter`] pushes the kebab-string
//! boundary out to the YAML parse step — `briefs.keys()` is now the
//! typed source-of-truth operation iterator, with serde rejecting any
//! unknown variant before downstream code ever sees a string.
//!
//! Resolution lives in [`super::resolve`]; schema validation and the
//! cross-axis collision probe in [`super::validate_manifest`]. This
//! module owns the manifest types, the path helpers, and the two
//! post-load coherence gates ([`check_axis_and_name`],
//! [`check_execution`]).
//!
//! See [DECISIONS.md §"Operations typed at parse boundary"] for the
