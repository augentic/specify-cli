//! Adapter manifest resolution.
//!
//! workflow §"Adapter implementation shape" / §"Resolver and cache".
//! Source and target adapters share the `adapter.yaml` wire shape but
//! split into [`SourceAdapter`] / [`TargetAdapter`] in memory, each
//! carrying its closed operation set ([`SourceOperation`] /
//! [`TargetOperation`]) as the typed `briefs.keys()` source-of-truth.
//! The split pushes the string boundary out to the YAML parse step;
//! see [DECISIONS.md §"Operations typed at parse boundary"] for the
//! rationale.
//!
//! Resolution is path-agnostic: each axis-specific loader probes
//! `<project_dir>/.specify/cache/manifests/{sources,targets}/<name>/`
//! first (the agent-populated manifest cache) and then
//! `<project_dir>/adapters/{sources,targets}/<name>/` (in-repo). The
//! manifest cache mirrors the in-repo adapter tree so source and
//! target adapters with colliding names disambiguate by axis. See
//! [DECISIONS.md §"Cache layout"].
//!
//! Brief bodies are read by the agent from paths declared in each
//! manifest's typed `briefs` map; the CLI never parses brief markdown.
//! Per the plugin-repo standard
//! ([`docs/standards/skill-authoring.md`](https://github.com/augentic/specify/blob/main/docs/standards/skill-authoring.md)
//! §"Brief authoring"), briefs carry no YAML frontmatter.
