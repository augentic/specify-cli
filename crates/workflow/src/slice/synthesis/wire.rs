//! Synthesis response wire DTO + input-envelope assembly.
//!
//! Synthesis is always agent-dispatched: there is no tool consumer, so
//! there is no closed *request* wire shape. The single schema-validated
//! wire is the **response**
//! ([`SynthesisResponse`], `kind: response`), validated against
//! `schemas/slice/synthesis.schema.json` by
//! [`crate::schema::validate_synthesis_json`] before C8 deserialises it
//! here. The response carries the agent's [`crate::slice::model::SliceModel`]
//! (kernel-owned and header fields omitted) plus the prose-only Markdown
//! [`SynthesisArtifacts`].
//!
//! The synthesis **inputs** the CLI hands the agent step are not
//! schema-validated (no closed request shape).
//! [`build_synthesis_inputs`] assembles them — each bound
//! source's inline `lead` and `claims` plus the resolved target shape
//! brief body — into the plain serialisable [`SynthesisInputs`] that
//! `specify slice synthesize --dry-run --format json` prints. Authority
//! is **not** included: the kernel resolves it from the on-disk Evidence
//! after the response returns.
//!
//! The assembly is pure over already-read inputs so it unit-tests
//! without a temp project; [`SynthesisSourceInput::from_evidence_file`]
//! is the only filesystem hook, kept off the core path and free of
//! adapter resolution (C8 resolves the [`crate::adapter::TargetAdapter`]
//! and reads the shape brief).
