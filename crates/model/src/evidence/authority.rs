//! Evidence authority enums — the closed `AuthorityClass` and
//! `ClaimKind` sets shared by `schemas/evidence.schema.json`,
//! `plan.yaml`'s per-slice `authority-override` map, and the slice
//! model.
//!
//! Authority resolves at document level via the per-Evidence
//! `authority:` field, with one operator override surface — the
//! per-slice `authority-override` on `plan.yaml`, keyed by claim kind
//! (decision-log §"Authority: document-level plus one override (v1)").
//! A per-Evidence `authority-overrides` map is deferred to a future
//! RFC.
