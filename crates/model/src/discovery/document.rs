//! In-memory model of `<project_dir>/discovery.md` — the
//! `## Lead inventory` section plus the surrounding operator
//! prose.
//!
//! discovery alias contract — `slices[].sources[].lead-id` resolves
//! first against a lead's `lead-id`, then against any entry in
//! `aliases[]`, within that binding's `source-key`. Each block is a
//! raw, unmerged lead identified by the `(source-key, lead-id)` pair.
//! The `## Lead inventory` section uses the block grammar
//!
//! ```markdown
//! ### <source-key>:<lead-id>
//!
//! - lead-id: <lead-id>
//! - source-key: <source-key>
//! - aliases: [<alias>, <alias>]
//! - summary: <one-line summary>
//! ```
//!
//! [`Discovery::load`] parses the file faithfully (preserving prose
//! before, between, and after lead blocks) and exposes the
//! `## Lead inventory` section as structured [`Lead`]
//! rows. [`Discovery::write_atomic`] re-renders the file with any
//! mutations propagated; prose around lead blocks round-trips
//! unchanged.
//!
//! The on-disk format intentionally mirrors what source adapters
//! write at `survey` time, so the same parser feeds re-survey
//! and operator edits.
