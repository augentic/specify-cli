//! The neutral [`Diagnostic`] currency and its closed attribute enums.
//!
//! A [`Diagnostic`] is the single structured finding shape shared by
//! both Specify surfaces: the advisory `lint` surface (`specrun lint`,
//! `specdev lint`, target-adapter review briefs, model-assisted
//! scorers, CI annotations) and the workflow-gating `validate`
//! surface (slice/plan structural invariants). The two surfaces stay
//! conceptually distinct — they differ in gate policy, not in
//! currency — so the substrate is named neutrally rather than after
//! either surface.
//!
//! Two orthogonal axes classify a diagnostic:
//!
//! - [`DiagnosticSource`] — *who produced it* (`deterministic`,
//!   `model-assisted`, `hybrid`, `human`, `tool`).
//! - [`DiagnosticKind`] — *what it asks of the reader*: a
//!   [`DiagnosticKind::Violation`] is a defect to fix; a
//!   [`DiagnosticKind::Review`] is a deterministically-raised request
//!   for agent or human judgment (e.g. a deferred semantic check).
//!   Only `violation` diagnostics are default-blocking — see
//!   [`blocking`].
//!
//! Field names are kebab-case at every nesting level. Producer-local
//! `id` (e.g. `FIND-0001`) is distinct from the codex `rule_id` (e.g.
//! `UNI-014`): `id` is a stable per-run handle and `rule_id` is the
//! durable codex citation.
//!
//! Severity comparator order is `Critical < Important < Suggestion <
//! Optional`; the closed enum is declared in that order so the derived
//! [`Ord`] picks up the contract-defined sort sequence.
