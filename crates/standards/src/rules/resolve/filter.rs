//! Applicability and deprecation filters (CH-13).
//!
//! Implements rule applicability, path-glob semantics, and
//! §"Overlay precedence" / §"Resolved Decisions". The CH-12 resolver
//! discovers every rule visible to the export envelope; this module
//! narrows that pool down to the rules that actually apply to the
//! caller's slice context, using the inclusive AND-across-dimensions
//! semantics the rules contract defines.
//!
//! # Precedence
//!
//! Three filters run in a fixed order:
//!
//! 1. **Origin (`core`)** — entries with [`super::super::Origin::Core`]
//!    are dropped unless [`ResolveInputs::include_core`] is set
//!    (consumer-export filtering). The check runs
//!    **first** so `CORE-*` rules never reach the deprecation or
//!    applicability passes on a default consumer export — even if the
//!    rule's `applicability` block would have accepted them.
//! 2. **Deprecation** — entries whose [`Rule::deprecated`] is
//!    populated are dropped unless [`ResolveInputs::include_deprecated`]
//!    is set. Deprecation runs before applicability so an
//!    `--include-deprecated` rule still walks through applicability
//!    normally (§"Overlay precedence": "Export includes every rule that
//!    passes applicability filtering" — `include_deprecated` does not
//!    bypass applicability).
//! 3. **Applicability** — a rule with no `applicability` block always
//!    passes ("A rule with no `applicability` block applies wherever
//!    its root applies"). A rule with an `applicability` block must
//!    pass **every populated dimension** (AND semantics).
//!
//! # Populated dimension + missing caller input
//!
//! Rule applicability closes the awkward edge case: if the rule
//! populates a dimension but the caller supplied no matching input, the
//! rule is **excluded** unless [`ResolveInputs::include_unmatched`] is
//! set. This module applies that rule per dimension.
//!
//! # Per-dimension matching
//!
//! - **`adapters`** — caller input is always populated
//!   ([`ResolveInputs::target_adapter`] is required), so the
//!   missing-input branch is unreachable. The rule matches when its
//!   adapter list contains either the target adapter or any bound
//!   source adapter. The rule's adapter ref may carry an optional
//!   `@v<major>` suffix; for v1 this module strips the suffix before
//!   comparison and matches by bare name.
//! - **`languages`** — case-sensitive bare-name match against
//!   [`ResolveInputs::languages`]. Missing caller input (empty slice)
//!   excludes the rule unless `include_unmatched`.
//! - **`artifacts`** — v1 has no `--artifact-kind` input on
//!   [`ResolveInputs`]. Per the closed
//!   populated-dimension-without-caller-input rule, any rule that
//!   populates `applicability.artifacts` is **excluded unless
//!   `include_unmatched` is set**. This is an honest reflection of v1
//!   capability; a future contract may add an explicit `--artifact-kind`
//!   input, after which `artifact_dimension_matches` would consult it
//!   the same way `language_dimension_matches` consults `languages`.
//! - **`paths`** — patterns interpreted by the `glob` crate
//!   (`glob = "0.3"`). Per the rules contract §"Path glob semantics
//!   (`applicability.paths`)": `*` matches a single path segment
//!   without crossing `/`, `**` matches across segments, and `/` is the
//!   only separator. Matching is case-sensitive. Caller paths are
//!   normalised to forward-slash separators on Windows before being
//!   tested. Missing caller input (empty [`ResolveInputs::artifact_paths`])
//!   excludes the rule unless `include_unmatched`.
//!
//! Malformed glob patterns are treated as **non-matching** rather than
//! aborting the resolver. `specify lint framework` catches
//! authoring bugs in patterns; surfacing a hard error here over a
//! single first-party typo would be more disruptive than dropping the
//! rule from the export. A future authoring-check could elevate this to
//! a hard error.
//!
//! # Composition
//!
//! Call [`super::resolve`] first, then pass its `Vec<ResolvedRuleEntry>`
//! to [`filter`] — e.g. `filter(super::resolve(inputs)?, inputs)`.
//! [`build_resolved_rules`] in the sibling `sort` module is the
//! conventional export entry point.
