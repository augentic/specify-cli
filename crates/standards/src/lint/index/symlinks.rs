//! Symlink fact recorder per the `WorkspaceModel` entity families and

//!
//! Called by the consumer and framework walkers for each entry whose
//! `file_type()` is a symlink. Under [`FollowMode::Record`] (the
//! consumer policy from the file scan contract) the link is visited
//! but the underlying target is never traversed and only the
//! `(path, target, broken)` triple is recorded. Under
//! [`FollowMode::Follow`] (the framework policy per the standards-layer
//! contract §F1) the recorder additionally canonicalises the link and
//! records the project-relative endpoint in [`Symlink::resolved_target`]
//! so review-team-protocol drift surfaces in the model. Cycle
//! detection lives in the caller — the recorder is stateless.
