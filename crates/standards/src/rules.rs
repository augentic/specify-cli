//! Codex DTOs and runtime wire types per the rules contract.
//!
//! Provides the typed Rust shapes that round-trip cleanly through the
//! schemas embedded under `schemas/rules/` and `schemas/diagnostics/`:
//!
//! - [`Rule`] / [`Deprecated`] / [`Applicability`] /
//!   [`RuleHint`] / [`Reference`] are the parsed-frontmatter
//!   shape used by the CH-11 frontmatter parser. Field names are
//!   kebab-case at every nesting level (`lint-mode`,
//!   `rule-hints`, `replaced-by`); the parser performs the
//!   `snake_case -> kebab-case` lift on the raw markdown side so the
//!   in-memory shape matches the wire shape.
//! - [`ResolvedRules`] / [`ResolvedRule`] are the export envelope
//!   emitted by `specify rules export --format json` (CH-17). They
//!   add resolver-only fields ([`Origin`], [`PathRoot`], `path`,
//!   `body`) on top of the codex-rule shape.
//!
//! Structured diagnostic types ([`specify_diagnostics::Diagnostic`],
//! renderers, fingerprint helpers) live in the neutral
//! [`specify_diagnostics`] leaf — import them from there directly.
//!
//! Severity comparator order is `Critical < Important < Suggestion <
//! Optional` and origin order is `Target < Source < Shared <
//! Unknown`, matching `ResolvedRules` export contract
//! §"Ordering". The closed enums are declared in the comparator order
//! so the derived [`Ord`] picks up the contract-defined sort sequence.
