# Decisions

Standing architectural decisions for the `specify` CLI. Read before changing error layering, exit codes, atomic writes, or the YAML library.

Each entry records the decision, why it was taken, and the consequences a change must reckon with — not how the feature works today. Current behavior lives in [`docs/standards/workflow.md`](./docs/standards/workflow.md) (the workflow contract), [`docs/standards/architecture.md`](./docs/standards/architecture.md) (workspace shape), and module-level rustdoc; entries here point at those rather than restating them.

## Error layering

`specify-error` is the dependency leaf of the workspace. It depends only on `thiserror` and `serde-saphyr`; every other `specify-*` crate may depend on it, and it depends on none of them. The leaf stays free of rich domain payloads: `Error::Validation { code, detail }` is payload-free (see [§"Drained `Error::Validation` and the `Diagnostic` substrate"](#drained-errorvalidation-and-the-diagnostic-substrate)) — the top-level wire `error` is the carried `code` discriminant, and rendered findings travel on stdout as a `DiagnosticReport`, not inside the error.

## Exit codes

The binary commits to a four-slot exit-code table. `Exit::from(&Error)` in `src/runtime/output.rs` is the single source of truth; every dispatcher routes its error through it. `Exit::Code(u8)` is reserved for `specify tool run` WASI passthrough.

| Code | Name                      | When                                                                                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | `EXIT_SUCCESS`            | Command succeeded.                                                                                                              |
| 1    | `EXIT_GENERIC_FAILURE`    | Any `Error` variant not listed below (I/O, YAML, schema, merge, tool resolver/runtime, ...).                                    |
| 2    | `EXIT_VALIDATION_FAILED`  | Validation findings, `Error::Validation`, `Error::Argument`, or a tool request rejected as undeclared.                          |
| 3    | `EXIT_VERSION_TOO_OLD`    | `project.yaml.specify_version` is newer than `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.                                                               |

`Exit::ArgumentError` and `Exit::ValidationFailed` are distinct Rust variants that share code `2`, keeping the wire contract four-slot while preserving dispatcher-side clarity — anything actionable by the operator is in the JSON envelope's `code` discriminant, and per-finding detail is on the stdout `DiagnosticReport`.

A pin **newer** than the binary is exit `3` (`Error::CliTooOld` — the binary must catch up). A pin *older* than the binary loads fine: pre-1.0 there are no compatibility shims and no migration framework — a major cut means re-init, not migration (see [§"Bootstrap and upgrade lifecycle"](#bootstrap-and-upgrade-lifecycle)).

`specify lint project` is the one finding-driven exit slot: it returns `2` only on a finding with `status: open` AND `severity ∈ {critical, important}` — see [§"Lint finding status, disposition, and exit"](#lint-finding-status-disposition-and-exit).

## Atomic writes

Use `yaml_write` (in `crates/model/src/atomic.rs`) for any file a concurrent reader may observe mid-write: `plan.yaml`, `metadata.yaml`, and the registry. It serialises to `NamedTempFile::new_in(parent)` and `persist`-renames over the target so readers either see the prior bytes or the new bytes. Plain `fs::write` is reserved for files no other process reads concurrently with the writer (one-shot scratch output, fixtures inside a tempdir test). `plan.lock` is the deliberate exception: `specify plan lock` writes its diagnostic body in place (`set_len(0)` + write on the locked fd), never via a rename — an atomic `persist`-rename would replace the inode and sever the OS advisory lock the open descriptor holds. The body is diagnostic noise (the lock identity is the file lock itself), so a reader that races the in-place write simply falls back to `holder-pid=unknown`.

## YAML library

The workspace uses `serde-saphyr` (pinned to a `0.0.x` release) for both deserialization and serialization. It is pure-Rust, panic-free, and actively maintained, in contrast to `serde_yaml` (deprecated) and `serde_yaml_ng` (community fork carrying the same debt). Saphyr omits a `Value` DOM, so code that needs untyped YAML access deserializes into `serde_json::Value`. Its separate deser/ser error types ride directly on `specify_error::Error::YamlDe` and `Error::YamlSer` (both `#[error(transparent)]` `#[from]` variants), so `?` on a raw `serde_saphyr` result still propagates and the kebab discriminant on the wire stays `yaml` for either side.

## Diag-first error policy

`Error::Diag { code, detail }` is the default for new diagnostics. A typed `Error::*` variant exists only when (a) a test or skill destructures the variant's payload, (b) the variant routes to a non-default `Exit` slot, or (c) three or more call sites share the exact shape. The kebab `code` is the wire contract; the Rust variant is for callers that pattern-match. See AGENTS.md §"Errors" for the full rule.

## Hint colocation

Long-form recovery hints live on `Error::hint(&self) -> Option<&'static str>`, not on the renderer. `ErrorBody::render_text` calls it. Adding a new hint means extending `Error::hint`, not the renderer. Hints for collapsed `Diag` codes are looked up by the kebab `code` so a `Diag` site without a typed variant can still surface guidance.

## Wire compatibility

The CLI's JSON output is a flat envelope: every successful body is the typed `*Body` rendered directly, every failure body is `ErrorBody`. Skills grep on the `error` / `code` discriminants; tests assert on them. There is no top-level `envelope-version` integer — re-introduce one only if a breaking shape change ships and consumers need a version stamp to refuse output they cannot parse.

The kebab-case `code` discriminant on `Error::*` variants is the public contract: renaming or removing one is breaking; adding a fresh one is additive. CLI **input** flags are a peer wire surface under the same rules — adding an optional flag is additive, removing or renaming a flag is breaking. One non-additive input change has shipped: `specify init` enforces the `<adapter>` xor `--workspace` invariant through clap rather than the historical post-parse `init-requires-adapter-or-workspace` envelope (the discriminant survives in `crates/workflow/src/init/` for embedders).

## Shell completions

`specify completions <shell>` writes a clap-generated completion script to stdout for any shell `clap_complete::Shell` covers. The script is a pure function of the live clap surface, so verb additions/removals are auto-tracked without extra plumbing.

## Crate layout

The crate graph (leaf → root, with per-crate roles) is pinned in [AGENTS.md §"Crate graph"](./AGENTS.md) and [architecture.md §"Workspace layout"](./docs/standards/architecture.md#workspace-layout); this entry records why the shape is what it is.

SHA-256 digest encoding lives in `specify_schema::digest` (the `specify-schema` leaf), so siblings such as `specify-standards` and `specify-diagnostics` share one digest implementation without depending on `specify-tool` (and therefore Wasmtime). `specify-model` exists so the artifact types and parsers sit on a lifecycle-free leaf; it also holds the artifact validation rule registry (`specify_model::validate`) and depends on neither `specify-workflow` nor anything named lint, so a validation rule physically cannot reach a slice transition or plan stamp — the same no-lifecycle-authority invariant `specify-standards` enforces. The init-time `AGENTS.md` context-fence generation lives in `specify_workflow::agents`, whose only consumer is the root binary.

No framework `CORE-*` rule uses the deleted `specify_standards::framework` `Check` substrate — every rule resolves through the generic lint dispatcher, with Road B checkers running in-process under `crates/standards/src/lint/framework_tools/`; see [§"Framework lint engine: generic dispatcher (Road A / Road B)"](#framework-lint-engine-generic-dispatcher-road-a--road-b). The former `Check` substrate (trait, `Context`, `builder.rs`, helpers) is deleted: its only live content was the repo-local Rust-quality predicates, which now live dev-only beside their single consumer at `tests/rust_quality/checks.rs` in the root crate, and the brief path-classification, which `crates/standards/src/lint/index/brief.rs` owns.

### New workspace crates

New functionality lands in an existing module by default. A new workspace crate requires a paragraph in this file justifying why an existing module cannot host the code, and what dependency-direction invariant the new crate enforces (which leaf-→-root edge it preserves, and which existing crate would have grown a cycle). A new crate that does not strengthen the dependency direction is overhead; refactor within an existing module instead. Adapter-specific logic never lands as a workspace crate — it lands in the adapter's WASI carve-out.

## Integration tests: one binary per area, themed submodules via `#[path]`

**Decision (2026-06).** Each `tests/*.rs` compiles to its own integration binary that links the entire crate-under-test, so total link time scales with the *number* of binaries, not lines of test code. We keep **one binary per area** rather than either extreme:

- A single `tests/it.rs` umbrella (all integration tests in one binary) was measured and rejected — the cold-build win was 7.3 % cargo-reported, below the 20 % bar we apply to "Idiomatic Rust Cleanup" chunks, and a mega-binary makes `cargo test --test <area>` useless for local iteration.
- Strictly one file per binary leaves dozens of near-identical binaries that each re-link the crate-under-test.

The middle ground: conceptually-related suites that share a helper module collapse their themed files under a sibling `tests/<area>/` directory wired with `#[path = "<area>/<concern>.rs"] mod <concern>;`. The hub `tests/<area>.rs` declares the shared helper once (`mod common;` / `mod eval_support;` / `mod engine_support;`); submodules reference it as `crate::common` etc. Merges never cross crate boundaries — each crate's `tests/` is its own compilation unit, and helpers like `copy_dir` are single-sourced per crate.

This collapsed 73 integration binaries to 30 (standards 24 → 5, host 34 → 16, workflow 9 → 7, vectis 6 → 2) while keeping every area runnable via `cargo test --test <area>` and every golden refreshable through the hub binary name (`REGENERATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo nextest run [-p <crate>] --test <area>`).

## Framework lint engine: generic dispatcher (Road A / Road B)

**Decision (2026-06).** The `specify lint framework` engine is a generic, rule-agnostic dispatcher carrying **no rule-specific check logic and no rule policy**. Every framework `CORE-*` check resolves through one of two roads, and `specify` (the framework repo) owns both the checks and the values they enforce:

- **Road A — declarative hint.** The rule carries a `kind:` ∈ `schema | reference-resolves | cardinality | set-coverage | constant-eq | unique | fenced-block | regex | path-pattern | presence | field-grammar | cross-reference | cli-contract`, interpreted by a generic per-kind evaluator in `crates/standards/src/lint/eval/*` over `WorkspaceModel` facts. (The `set-coverage` kind subsumes the former `set-eq`: its `config: { mode: exact }` provides the two-sided comparison.) `hint.value` names the mechanism selector and `hint.config` carries the policy. The per-kind selector semantics live in the eval modules' rustdoc and [AGENTS.md §"Crate graph"](./AGENTS.md) (`crates/standards/src/lint/` bullet).
- **Road B — referenced tool.** The rule carries `kind: tool, value: <tool>` plus a sentinel `path-pattern`. `lint/eval/tool.rs` resolves the tool **by name**, runs it once per lint, and folds its findings (stamped with the tool's own `rule_id` / `severity`; the engine restamps only `id` / `fingerprint`). For framework lint the inventory is the in-process `framework_tools` checker table in `specify-standards` (described below), called directly for typed findings; for project lint the name routes through the `ToolRunner` trait to the declared WASI tool inventory, whose `DiagnosticReport` stdout the evaluator parses.

**Policy lives in the rule's `config:`**, in `specify`. Road A reads it directly; Road B has it forwarded as a second positional argument — the engine relays, it never interprets. Enforced permanently by the Layer-3 guard test [`crates/standards/tests/lint_engine_guards/no_embedded_policy.rs`](./crates/standards/tests/lint_engine_guards/no_embedded_policy.rs), which fails if any eval arm reintroduces a rule-specific literal. The only engine-side constants left are mechanism (evidence-size / snippet / iteration bounds).

**There is no `kind: authoring-predicate`.** The engine carries no imperative rule predicates and no duplicated owner maps; all policy rides the rule's `config:`.

**Six framework checkers run in-process.** The Road B framework checkers (`scenarios`, `skill-body`, `links-registry`, `marketplace`, `prose`, `rules`) are native Rust modules under [`crates/standards/src/lint/framework_tools/`](./crates/standards/src/lint/framework_tools.rs), beside the engine in `specify-standards`. The `kind: tool` evaluator resolves a checker name against the `framework_tools` inventory (`is_framework_checker` / `run_checker`) before the `ToolRunner` trait is consulted, calling it directly and folding the typed `Diagnostic` findings — no `ToolRunner` hop and no JSON serialise→reparse round-trip. Each checker receives `(candidate-path, config-json)` argv, reads policy only from the rule's forwarded `config:`, and returns findings the evaluator restamps (`id` / `fingerprint`): `requested_rule` matches the candidate filename exactly; the prose checker parses `description.maxLength` from the canonical embedded skill schema; a missing project dir surfaces findings instead of silently passing. The `ToolRunner` trait (and `NoopToolRunner`, which backs the framework surface) survives only for the project-side WASI path. WASM remains for the adapter validators (`contract`, `vectis`), which ship to consumer projects and keep the sandbox + digest sidecar trust anchor.

Test coverage rests on the per-kind evaluator unit suites (`crates/standards/src/lint/eval/*`), the `no_embedded_policy` guard, the schema byte-match gate (`crates/schema/tests/schemas.rs`), and each checker module's unit tests.

## Tool architecture

`specify-tool` owns the declared WASI tool cache, resolver, and Wasmtime-backed execution host, deliberately independent of the adapter loader: the binary resolves adapters, then hands this crate the tool declarations. The manifest DTOs (`Tool`, `ToolSource`, `ToolPermissions`, `ToolScope`, `PackageRequest`, `ToolManifest`) and their structural validation live in the wasmtime-free leaf `specify-tool-manifest`, re-exported by `specify-tool` under the historical `manifest` / `validate` module paths. The split exists for one consumer: `specify-workflow` reads the `tools:` field on `project.yaml` (and the init-time wasm-pkg config constants) and must not pull `wasmtime` into its compile graph — workflow depends on `specify-tool-manifest` only, never on `specify-tool`. The standing policy choices:

- **Declaration sites.** Project scope (`tools:` in `.specify/project.yaml`) and adapter scope (a `tools.yaml` sidecar next to `adapter.yaml`); both validate against `schemas/tool.schema.json`. Merge is by `name`, project scope winning with a `tool-name-collision` warning. `adapter.yaml` itself never gains a `tools:` field.
- **Cache layout.** Root resolves `$SPECIFY_EXTENSIONS_CACHE` → `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/specify/extensions/` → `$HOME/.cache/specify/extensions/`; scope segments and the `--` separator are pinned in [architecture.md §"WASI tool sidecar scope"](./docs/standards/architecture.md#wasi-tool-sidecar-scope). `<version>` is the literal manifest string; SemVer is parsed only at structural validation. The wasmtime compilation cache lives beside the scope dirs at `<root>/wasmtime/` (override: `$SPECIFY_WASMTIME_CACHE`); it is best-effort and never consulted by `tool gc`.
- **Sidecar invalidation.** `meta.yaml` records `(scope, tool-name, tool-version, source, sha256)`; any mismatch with the live merged manifest forces a refetch via atomic move. When `sha256` is present, fetched bytes are verified before installation. Permissions changes alone never invalidate the cache — permissions are evaluated per `run`.
- **Permission substitution.** Substitutions apply only inside `permissions.{read,write}` (not `source`, not module argv). After substitution paths must be absolute, free of `..`, and canonicalise inside the granted root. `write:` entries targeting Specify lifecycle state are rejected.
- **Argument forwarding and environment.** `specify tool run <name> [-- <args>...]` forwards everything after `--` verbatim with `<name>` as `argv[0]`. The module receives exactly two environment variables (`PROJECT_DIR` always, the adapter-scope dir only for adapter-scope tools) plus stdio; no host environment is inherited.
- **Exit-code mapping.** Module exit `N` passes through (`Exit::Code`); runtime trap and resolver error are `2` with typed envelopes; missing project context is `1` (`not-initialized`); unknown tool name is `2` (`tool-not-declared`).
- **Wasmtime configuration.** Pin `wasmtime` / `wasmtime-wasi` to a matching stable pair, use the synchronous WASI Preview 2 path and `component::Component`, and disable filesystem access by default — preopens come from manifest permissions only. Execution stays behind the concrete `WasiRunner` boundary.
- **Cache concurrency.** No file locks in v1; concurrent cold-cache resolutions may both stage, and the resolver's atomic rename makes the steady state deterministic. A per-tool flock is deferred until needed.
- **`specify tool gc` scope.** Deletes cache entries not referenced by the live merged manifest of the current project; it does not scan other projects on the host.
- **Registry resolution.** Wasm-pkg config is layered, last-write-wins: global defaults → project-local `.specify/wasm-pkg.toml` → `WKG_CONFIG` → an embedded `specify -> augentic.io` namespace fallback. `specify init` scaffolds the checked-in `.specify/wasm-pkg.toml` and never overwrites an operator-edited file; the previous hardcoded GHCR prefix is gone (`meta.yaml`'s `oci.reference` derives best-effort from the registry's wasm-pkg metadata).
- **Time crate.** UTC-only domain on `jiff::Timestamp`; all persisted stamps route through `specify_error::serde_rfc3339` so the wire shape stays `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` byte-for-byte.

## Source and target adapter role names

The output-role domain types are spelled `Target*` (`Target`, `Slice.target`, the `slice-create-target-missing` / `init-requires-adapter-or-workspace` discriminants, plus every fixture, JSON envelope, and call site). The shared manifest *shape* is loaded by the axis-aware module `crates/workflow/src/adapter/` (`SourceAdapter` / `TargetAdapter` / `Axis` / `ResolvedAdapter` / `AdapterLocation`). Briefs are resolved by path through `briefs.<op>`; they carry no YAML frontmatter and the CLI never reads their bodies. The slice-metadata wire uses `Operation { Shape, Build, Merge }` (`phase: shape | build | merge`).

Per workflow §"Note to the implementing agent", touching any of these symbols requires a cross-repo `rg` sweep against `augentic/specify-cli` and `augentic/specify` in the same PR.

## Adapter loader axis routing

`SourceAdapter::resolve` / `TargetAdapter::resolve` probe the out-of-tree manifest cache (`<project-cache>/manifests/{sources,targets}/<name>/`) then the in-repo tree (`adapters/{sources,targets}/<name>/`) — order and layout pinned in [workflow.md §"Resolver and cache"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#resolver-and-cache). The decisions:

- **Resolution is project-local only.** There is no environment-variable fallback to an out-of-tree framework checkout. A project carries a manifest-cache mirror or a vendored `adapters/` tree, or lets the first-party shorthand fetch at `init` time; a miss on both is `adapter-not-found`.
- **The axis segment is load-bearing.** `sources` / `targets` keeps colliding names disambiguated by axis; cache placement matches the probe layout (`cache_dir(axis, name)`). See [§"Cache layout"](#cache-layout).

### First-party `<adapter>` shorthand at init

`specify init <adapter>` accepts a first-party **shorthand** — `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*(@<semver>)?$` (`omnia`, `omnia@1.0.0`) — alongside the local-path and GitHub-URL forms. A bare name carries no version pin (resolves the single installed identity); a `name@<semver>` pin records the full `name@<semver>` identity on `project.yaml.adapter` (RFC-47). `AdapterUri::parse` (`crates/workflow/src/init/adapter_uri.rs`) expands the shorthand to the canonical published adapter `https://github.com/augentic/specify/adapters/targets/<name>@<git-ref>`, deriving the **git checkout ref `v<major>`** from the pinned semver (transport stays repo-ref until RFC-48). `init` is target-only, so the shorthand resolves under `adapters/targets/`; anything carrying `:` or `/` (including a `@v<major>` git-ref form) is not semver shorthand and continues through `from_local` / `from_github` unchanged.

### Adapter identity: semver version + `AdapterRef` (RFC-47)

`adapter.yaml.version` is a **required semver string** (`x.y.z` with optional `-prerelease` / `+build`), enforced by the per-axis JSON Schema and parsed into `SourceAdapter.version` / `TargetAdapter.version` as a typed `semver::Version`. It is the adapter's **identity**, not a descriptive field: synthesized target refs (`topology.lock`, proposal, slice metadata, build-report) render `name@<semver>`, and `TargetRef::parse` requires the `name@<semver>` form (the legacy `name@v<major>` is no longer a valid target).

The loader threads identity through a value type — `AdapterRef { name: String, version: Option<semver::Version> }` (`crates/workflow/src/adapter/core.rs`). `SourceAdapter::resolve` / `TargetAdapter::resolve` take `&AdapterRef`; `locate_axis` stays name-only for the probe (project-local single-identity world). Two gates back the identity:

- **`adapter-version-malformed`** — the post-schema load gate (`check_version`) rejects a manifest whose raw `version` is absent or not exact semver, before typed deserialization, so the diagnostic names the field rather than surfacing a generic parse error.
- **`adapter-version-required`** — `check_requested_version` rejects a pin (`AdapterRef.version = Some(_)`) that does not match the installed manifest identity. Latent in the single-identity world (a `None` pin always picks the installed identity); wired now so RFC-48's multi-identity store widens the same seam.
- **`adapter-cli-too-old`** — RFC-47 D3 host-CLI compatibility floor. `adapter.yaml` carries an optional `specify` semver string (parsed into `requires_specify: Option<semver::Version>`); the post-schema gate `check_requires_specify` compares it against the running binary (`env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`) and aborts with `Error::AdapterCliTooOld` on the exit-3 `EXIT_VERSION_TOO_OLD` path when the binary is older — the adapter-granularity analog of the `project.yaml.specify_version` floor. Exact floor only (no ranges, matching the version-pin posture); absent means no floor. The check is transport-independent (identical for `Local`, `Cached`, and any future registry tree).

A `sources.<key>.version` optional pin on `SourceBinding` (and `sourceBinding` in `plan.schema.json`) carries the same `Option<semver::Version>` — additive, so existing `plan.yaml` binds parse unchanged.

**Transport is unchanged.** Distribution stays a git sparse checkout of `augentic/specify`; the shorthand derives the git checkout ref `v<major>` from the pinned semver. A per-adapter release index, `(name, adapter-version)` cache identity, and third-party namespacing (`org/name@req`) remain **RFC-48 / RM-21 forward position with no pre-1.0 commitment** — RFC-47 lands only the identity, resolve-signature, and exact host-CLI floor, not the packaging/transport change. A semver-*range* `specify`-floor policy or a cross-version compatibility matrix stays deferred to RM-21.

## Plan lifecycle: two stored states

`plan.yaml.lifecycle` is `pending | approved` — no plan-level `in-progress` or `drained` ships in v1; "drained" is computed at read time as "every entry is `done`", not stored. Per-entry status is the closed `pending | in-progress | done` with split writer ownership (see [§"Lifecycle write-ownership"](#lifecycle-write-ownership)). `specify plan transition <plan-name> approved` is Gate 1 and operator-only: the CLI deliberately does not gate it (operators run it from any shell), the `--help` text documents the rule, and `/spec:plan` skill bodies MUST NOT call it.

Per-entry status walks backwards only via `specify plan transition <entry> --undo`, which refuses to skip rungs — exactly `Done → InProgress` and `InProgress → Pending` per call, one `plan.transition.undone` journal event per rung. `Status::Reopened` does not exist: an undone `done` row walks back to `in-progress` so the operator can re-run `/spec:build` and re-merge without a new state. If an upstream revert demands a redo without re-running the slice, author a fresh slice; the original `done` row stays as the historical record. Plan-level lifecycle has no undo path in v1.

Archive is a filesystem operation, not a lifecycle state: `specify plan archive` moves `change.md` + `plan.yaml` into `.specify/archive/plans/`, and the lifecycle stamp inside the archived file stays `approved`. There is no `archived` enum variant — the on-disk location is the signal.

## `SliceSourceBinding`: bare shorthand plus structured form

`plan.yaml.slices[].sources` is one in-memory struct (`{ source_key, lead_id: Option }`) with a custom `Deserialize` accepting two wire shapes and a `Serialize` emitting whichever shape produced the value: the bare string `legacy` (lead falls back to the owning slice's name via `lead_id(slice_name)` — the one-source-per-slice degenerate case, predominantly `intent`), and the structured `{ source, lead }` (required whenever key and lead differ).

Collapsing the variants into one struct means every consumer goes through the same `source_key()` / `lead_id()` accessors instead of `match`-ing a discriminator — the shorthand stays a pure parser concern. Construct in tests via `SliceSourceBinding::bare(..)` / `::structured(..)`. Refer to workflow §"Source".

## `Divergence` enum

`plan.yaml.slices[].divergence` is the closed enum `none | likely | accepted | rejected` (kebab-case wire; `none` is the elided default). `specify plan amend --divergence` only accepts `accepted | rejected` — `likely` is reserved for the `propose` sub-step of `/spec:plan`. Operators flipping the field after Gate 1 use `accepted | rejected` exclusively. Refer to workflow §"Plan-time reconciliation".

RFC-46 D4 adds the sibling `plan.yaml.slices[].disagreements[]` (`{ field, values: [{ source, value }] }`, the `Disagreement` / `DisagreementValue` types), authored by the propose agent alongside a `divergence` flag and carried from the proposal `responseSlice` onto the plan entry by the reconcile kernel. The CLI never decides materiality; `Plan::validate` only checks structural consistency and surfaces it as **advisory** (`Suggestion`) findings: `slice-divergence-unrecorded` (a live `likely`/`accepted` flag without ≥2 distinct source values per recorded field) and `slice-divergence-orphan-values` (recorded values with no flag). Both are deliberately non-blocking — `divergence` is operator-settable standalone via `plan amend --divergence` (advisory metadata in v1), so a divergence-consistency finding may never break that contract-locked write; it surfaces at `plan validate` / Gate 1 instead.

## Plan per-slice authority overrides

`plan.yaml.slices[]` carries an optional `authority-override` map keyed by claim kind, valued by source key. Keys come from the closed claim-kind enum; values MUST be source keys present in the slice's own `sources[]` list — orphans are rejected by `specify slice validate` (`slice-authority-override-orphan-source`). The map is scoped to one slice; plan-wide and project-wide overrides are out of scope.

## Extraction is agent-only — no cache, no fingerprints

Source extraction supports exactly one execution mode: `agent`. The deterministic-extraction substrate that once sat behind it — the extraction cache at `.specify/cache/extractions/<adapter>/`, the closed five-input `CacheFingerprint`, the `cache: opt-out` manifest field, the `source.survey.cache-hit/-miss` and `slice.extract.cache-hit/-miss` journal events with their `CacheMissReason` enum, the `Flow::dispatch_tool` seam in the source op kernel, and `specify source resolve --explain` — was deleted per YAGNI. Agent outputs are non-deterministic, so no run was ever served from the cache; the machinery only constrained changes to the live agent path. `source.schema.json` now enumerates `execution: ["agent"]` for sources (targets keep `agent | tool` — the target-side WASI build dispatch is real). The finalize phases emit plain completion events (`source.survey.completed` / `slice.extract.completed`) instead of cache-probe outcomes. If a deterministic source ever lands, re-add caching behind a fresh decision — the journal taxonomy and manifest schema are the seams to widen.

## Journal event names

`crates/workflow/src/journal.rs` emits the closed journal event taxonomy. The wire ids are dotted kebab-case; the Rust `EventKind` variants are `snake_case` and bridge to the wire via `#[serde(rename = "…")]`. The taxonomy is:

| Wire id                                                 | Emitted by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `plan.transition.approved`                              | `specify plan transition <plan> approved` (Gate 1 stamp) and `specify plan create --auto-approve`. Payload carries `plan-name` plus the closed `actor` enum (`operator \| agent`, default `operator`) — self-reported via `plan transition --actor` (create always records `operator`); grading evidence for eval probes, not enforcement. Absent on pre-actor journal lines; deserialises as `operator`. |
| `plan.transition.undone`                                | `specify plan transition <entry> --undo` (per-entry reverse rung; one event per rung).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `plan.entry.advanced`                                   | `specify plan next`, only when an entry actually moves `pending → in-progress` (the sole writer of that status). Returning the active entry or reporting drained/stuck emits nothing, so probes can read "parked, did not advance" from the journal window. Payload carries `plan-name` and `slice-name`. |
| `plan.amend.divergence`                                 | `specify plan amend --divergence likely\|accepted\|rejected` on any change to a slice's `divergence` field (the `/spec:plan` agent stages `likely`; the operator flips `accepted`/`rejected`).                                                                                                         |
| `plan.reconcile.completed`                              | `specify plan propose --from`, once, after the `plan.yaml` write commits (payload: `plan-name`, `slice-count`, `slice-names[]`).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `slice.transition.refined`                              | `specify slice transition <slice> refined`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `slice.extract.completed`                               | `specify source extract --phase finalize`, once per `(source, slice)` after the Evidence validates and persists. CLI-owned — the `/spec:refine` skill never emits it via `specify journal emit`.                                                                                                       |
| `slice.synthesize.started`                              | `specify slice synthesize --from` at the start of the projecting/persisting pass. Payload carries `slice-name`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `slice.synthesize.agent`                                | `specify slice synthesize --dry-run` after assembling the agent inputs envelope. One event per invocation; payload carries `slice-name`.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `slice.synthesize.completed`                            | `specify slice synthesize --from` once every artifact validated and persisted. Payload carries `slice-name` and the persisted `artifacts[]`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `slice.synthesize.failed`                               | `specify slice synthesize --from` aborted before all artifacts were persisted. Payload carries `slice-name` and a short `reason` / finding code.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `slice.synthesis.conflict` / `.divergence` / `.unknown` | `specify slice validate`, one per requirement-block tag emitted by the synthesis substep. (Distinct from the `slice.synthesize.*` lifecycle quartet above — see §"Slice synthesis engine".)                                                                                               |
| `slice.build.started` / `.succeeded` / `.failed`        | `/spec:build`'s target-adapter build flow; one per slice. Payloads carry `slice-name`; the `.failed` variant adds a short `reason` / finding code.                                                                                                                                        |
| `slice.merge.started` / `.succeeded` / `.failed`        | `specify slice merge`'s validator outcome — fires on the validator result, not on a merge report. Payloads carry `slice-name`; the `.failed` variant adds a short `reason` / finding code.                                                                                                |
| `source.survey.completed`                               | `specify source survey --phase finalize`, once the lead set validates and merges into `discovery.md`; payload carries `source` and `adapter`. CLI-owned.                                                                                                                                               |
| `source.execution.agent`                                | The `survey` / `extract` runner on every `execution: agent` invocation; payload carries `source`, `adapter`, and the closed `SourceOperation` (`survey` \| `extract`).                                                                                                                                 |
| `target.execution.agent`                                | `/spec:build`'s target-adapter build flow on every agent invocation; payload carries `slice` and `target` derived from the bound project.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `slice.archive.created`                                 | `specify slice merge`'s archive step (the append-only outcome ledger). Payload carries `slice-name`, `touched-specs`, `outcome-summary`, and the optional `merge-sha`. See §"History via git plus an outcome ledger".                                                                                  |
| `slice.replay.completed`                                | Target adapter's `build` step when it consumes runtime captures; optional in v1. runtime capture semantics.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `plan.amend.authority-override`                         | `specify plan create --authority-override`, `specify plan amend --authority-override` / `--clear-authority-override` / `--clear-authority-overrides`. per-slice authority override semantics.                                                                                                          |
| `lint-completed`                                        | `specify lint project` after each scan (the `specify lint framework` development surface does **not** journal — it sets `journal: false` in [`src/output.rs`](./src/output.rs)); payload carries `scope`, `duration_ms`, per-status `counts.{open, ignored, false_positive}`, and the resolved `exit_code`. Wire field names are snake_case to match the journal payload verbatim. |
| `cli.upgraded`                                          | `specify upgrade` after the new binary self-updates; payload carries `from`, `to`, and the resolved install `channel` (`cargo \| brew \| binary`).                                                                                                                                                     |
| `plugins.refreshed`                                     | `specify plugins refresh` after it invalidates the Cursor plugin cache; payload carries the removed `deleted-paths[]` and the resolved `marketplace` file path.                                                                                                                                        |
| `workspace.sync.completed`                              | `specify workspace sync` after the selected slots materialise and `topology.lock` regenerates; payload carries the synced `projects[]` names. The registry-less no-op path emits nothing.                                                                                                              |
| `workspace.push.completed`                              | `specify workspace push` after a non-dry-run invocation with no failed project (non-failure outcomes like `local-only` / `up-to-date` count as success); payload carries `plan-name`, the `specify/<plan-name>` `branch`, and the covered `projects[]`. Dry runs and failed pushes emit nothing.        |

Events persist as newline-delimited JSON at `<project_dir>/.specify/journal.jsonl`. The closed `from` / `to` enum on the divergence events is `none | likely | accepted | rejected`. Refer to workflow §"Observability".

### `specify journal emit` — guarded front door (D12)

Deterministic commands emit their own events. Agent-orchestrated phases that have no deterministic emit command write through `specify journal emit <event-id> [--payload <json>] [--format json]`. The verb mints **no event kinds of its own** — it is a guarded front door onto the same closed `EventKind` taxonomy, preserving "one closed taxonomy, one writer". The closed enum is itself the per-kind payload schema (no parallel JSON-schema registry): the handler reassembles the adjacently-tagged `{ event, payload }` shape and deserialises it into `EventKind`. An unknown tag fails `journal-emit-unknown-event`; a missing required field fails `journal-emit-payload-schema` (both exit 2). The CLI — never the agent — stamps the UTC `timestamp` and appends exactly one line.

## `$CAPABILITY_DIR` replaces `$ADAPTER_DIR`

The WASI tool runner's plugin-scope substitution variable is `$CAPABILITY_DIR`. It expands to the resolved plugin's root directory (the out-of-tree `<project-cache>/manifests/{sources,targets}/<name>/` or the in-repo equivalent) and is only valid in `permissions.{read,write}` entries (and the `source:` URI of a plugin-scope tool); project-scope references are rejected as `tool.capability-dir-out-of-scope` / `tool.source-capability-dir-out-of-scope`. The paired tool cache scope segment is `plugin--<axis>--<slug>` (project-scope tools keep `project--<project-name>`). Refer to workflow §"Sandboxing".

`$CAPABILITY_DIR` is also the read-only manifest-cache root of the four-root source-operation sandbox; see [§"Source operations"](#source-operations).

## Lifecycle write-ownership

Per-entry status writes route to exactly one CLI verb. Skill bodies never write status by hand; the CLI is the single source of truth for each transition:

| State                     | Writer                                    | Trigger                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending` (per-entry)     | `specify plan add` / `specify plan amend` | Operator (or `/spec:plan`) authors / edits a slice row.                                                                                                    |
| `in-progress` (per-entry) | `specify plan next`                       | Sole writer; the `/spec:execute` loop calls it once per slice.                                                                                             |
| `done` (per-entry)        | `specify plan transition <entry> done`    | Called by `/spec:merge` after `specify slice merge` succeeds.                                                                                              |
| `pending` (plan-level)    | `specify plan create`                     | `/spec:plan` scaffolds the plan in `pending`.                                                                                                              |
| `approved` (plan-level)   | `specify plan transition <plan> approved` | Operator-only (Gate 1). The CLI is ungated; `/spec:plan` MUST NOT call this verb — `--help` text documents the rule and the skill body is the actual gate. |

The plan-level `approved` row is the lightest-touch shape the workflow allows: a wholly operator-driven stamp with no CLI-side authentication. Skills that drift from this contract get caught at review time. Refer to workflow §"CLI surface" and §"Writer ownership".

## Plan source bindings

The on-disk shape of `plan.yaml.sources.<key>` is the structured `{ adapter, path?, value? }` object — the 1.x bare-string shorthand was dropped at the Specify 2.0 cut. Every binding carries an explicit kebab-case `adapter` and exactly one of `path` / `value`, enforced in both the JSON Schema and the Rust loader. The `specify plan create --source` flag grammar mirrors the wire shape:

| Form                                       | Materialises as                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--source <key>=<adapter>:<path>`          | `SourceBinding { adapter, path: Some(<path>), value: None }`    |
| `--source <key>=<adapter>:value:<literal>` | `SourceBinding { adapter, path: None, value: Some(<literal>) }` |

The adapter is the substring up to the first `:` after `=`; the binding payload is everything after it, so URLs containing `:` round-trip through the path form unchanged, and the `value:` sentinel switches the parser to literal mode (the literal may contain any character without escaping). No shorthand exists for "the adapter name equals the key". Source keys are plan-scoped; each key maps to exactly one binding, but slices may reference the same key with different leads.

## Adapter manifest requireds

`description` is required at the top level of every adapter manifest — sources and targets alike — alongside `name`, `version`, `axis`, and `briefs`. `tools[].version` is required for every declared tool, semver only (`^\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[0-9A-Za-z.-]+)?$` — no `v` prefix, no digest, no free-form strings): tools without a release must cut one before being declared, so every dispatched tool carries an auditable version and two adapter revisions can never share an ambiguous tool identity. Enforced uniformly by all three adapter schemas.

## Adapter name uniqueness

Adapter names are unique across axes — a name is declared under `adapters/sources/<name>/` xor `adapters/targets/<name>/`, never both (likewise their manifest-cache mirrors). Eagerly enforced at `specify init` (`init/cache.rs::cache_adapter`) and at every `*Adapter::resolve` (`adapter/core.rs::locate_axis` probes the opposite axis for a sibling manifest; `specify` is fork-and-exit, so two `is_file` probes beat memoised process-global state). Collisions surface as `adapter-name-axis-collision`, naming both axes so operators can rename or delete one side without grepping the tree.

## Target platform capability and init validation

Target adapters may declare an optional `platforms` capability (`{ required: bool, allowed: [Platform], default: [Platform] }`) in their manifest. `PlatformsCapability` lives on `TargetAdapter` in `crates/workflow/src/adapter/core.rs`; the schema shape is in `target.schema.json`. When `required` is true, `specrun init` demands `--platforms <csv>` and enforces three validation rules (all exit 2): `project-platforms-required` (target requires platforms but flag absent), `project-platforms-must-include-core` (`core` missing from the set), and `project-platforms-not-allowed` (a token outside `allowed`). The same three rules re-fire as backstops at `TopologyProject::resolve` (`topology-cache-project-platforms-*`). The mutation path is `specrun init --upgrade --platforms <csv>` — `--platforms` is deliberately excluded from the `--upgrade` conflict set. The `Platform` enum (`Core | Ios | Android | Web | Desktop`, kebab on the wire) lives in `crates/workflow/src/platform.rs`.

`platforms` rides the same topology projection rails as `target`: `TopologyProject` and `topology-lock.schema.json` carry it, `workspace sync` re-projects it, and the propose `projectRef` envelope threads it into the reconciliation request. Greenfield `scaffold_greenfield` injects the manifest's `default` when the target declares `platforms.required`.

Plan-time platform reconciliation is a CLI-owned deterministic pass, not agent judgment. `propose --from` always runs the bootstrap post-pass when a bound project declares non-empty `project.yaml.platforms` (no opt-out flag). For Vectis-bound projects, [`vectis_missing_platforms`](crates/workflow/src/platform/detect.rs) links [`specify-vectis-shell-detect`](crates/vectis-shell-detect/) in-process — the same heuristics the vectis `verify --mode detect` WASM wrapper exposes — to probe for on-disk shell trees; propose and plan validate do not dispatch vectis WASM. Non-Vectis targets return an empty missing set. For any supported platform (`core`, `ios`, `android`) declared but absent on disk, `Plan::reconcile_platforms` inserts a bootstrap slice (`app-foundation` for greenfield, `bootstrap-<platform>` for incremental) with all agent-proposed feature slices wired as `depends-on`, in the same atomic `plan.yaml` write. `plan-reconcile-bootstrap-name-collision` extends the closed D2 vocabulary. Bootstrap context for later `app-icon` gates keys off this detect output only — see [RFC-46 Phase 0](https://github.com/augentic/specify/blob/main/rfcs/rfc-46-asset-materialization.md#phase-0--platform-bootstrap-inference-prerequisite) and §6.1 there.

## Cache layout

`.specify/` is **Specify's directory: committed config plus system-of-record** (`project.yaml`, `specs/`, `slices/`, `archive/`, `journal.jsonl`, the lock sidecars). Its lone gitignored in-tree tenant is **`.specify/scratch/`** — transient working state: per-run lanes recreated empty by their owning verb, deletable at any time at zero cost. Everything regenerable and machine-owned now lives *outside* the working tree:

- **The cache is out-of-tree.** The adapter manifest mirror and the distributed codex live in a per-project directory inside the user's OS cache (`$SPECIFY_PROJECT_CACHE`, else `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/specify/projects/<project-id>/`, else `~/.cache/...`), keyed by a stable digest of the canonicalised project path (see [`crates/schema/src/cache.rs`](./crates/schema/src/cache.rs)). Each checkout — including each materialised workspace slot — gets its own collision-free cache that survives `git clean` and never pollutes the working tree.
- **Workspace slots are top-level.** Materialised registry peers live at `<project>/workspace/<peer>/`, not under `.specify/`. Remote peers are `git worktree`s of a persistent out-of-tree bare mirror (`$SPECIFY_MIRROR_CACHE`, else `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/specify/mirrors/<url-id>.git`), so a peer's object store is shared across changes and fresh checkouts; local peers stay symlinks.

`ensure_gitignore_entries` therefore writes exactly two entries — `.specify/scratch/` and the top-level `workspace/`. There is no in-tree `.specify/cache/` to ignore.

The out-of-tree per-project cache hosts two root-disjoint tenants, each self-describing via a provenance stamp so the cache root holds only directories:

- `manifests/{sources,targets}/<name>/` — the adapter manifest mirror (per-axis because adapter names are unique per axis), with provenance at `manifests/manifest-meta.yaml`.
- `codex/` — the distributed shared-rules codex, with provenance at `codex/codex-meta.yaml`. See [§"Shared codex distribution"](#shared-codex-distribution).

There is no extraction-result cache — see [§"Extraction is agent-only — no cache, no fingerprints"](#extraction-is-agent-only--no-cache-no-fingerprints). A manifest-cache directory is therefore always a manifest mirror; the loader never probes for co-tenancy.

`.specify/scratch/` hosts the per-run lanes: `<adapter>/{survey,<slice>}/` (the `$SCRATCH_DIR` preopens, recreated empty at `prepare` time) and `plan/` (the plan-phase handoff lane — `plan propose --dry-run` recreates it empty so `--from` can never consume a stale `propose-response.json`). The write-only `$SCRATCH_DIR` preopen stays rooted inside `.specify/scratch/`, structurally disjoint from the out-of-tree cache, so a scratch write can never pollute a cache artifact.

## Target adapter suffix policy

A plan slice does not store its target adapter. `plan.yaml.slices[]` carries only a `project`; the target (`name@vN`) is a denormalised copy of `project → adapter` and is **resolved on demand** from the bound project's topology rather than persisted. The 1:1 `project → target` invariant ("one target per project") is what makes the denormalisation removal safe. The integer `N` remains a load-bearing wire field wherever a resolved target *does* appear (`specify plan next`, slice `metadata.yaml`, the build request).

- `slices[].project` is optional on disk: omitted resolves to the sole project in the topology; a multi-project workspace requires it explicitly. The plan schema carries no `target` property — a slice may legitimately carry neither field.
- `propose.rs::resolve_target` is the single read-time resolver (`plan-reconcile-project-orphan` / `plan-reconcile-project-binding-required` / `plan-target-malformed`); `TargetRef` is constructed by it, never deserialised from `plan.yaml`.
- `specify plan validate` flags an omitted `project` only when a multi-project registry makes it ambiguous; `specify plan next` resolves best-effort and reports `target: null` rather than failing the lifecycle query — the build phase re-resolves before use.

## Operations typed at parse boundary

Adapter operations are typed Rust enums by the time YAML parsing finishes; string operation names never survive past the manifest loader. The decorative `operations:` array was removed from every manifest and schema — `briefs.keys()` is the canonical iterator over an adapter's declared operations, with the closed `SourceOperation` / `TargetOperation` enums (`crates/workflow/src/adapter/operation.rs`) as the typed key sets carried by the axis-split `SourceAdapter` / `TargetAdapter` structs.

**Wire invariant.** The `source resolve` / `target resolve` envelopes' `operations: [...]` arrays iterate in kebab-alphabetical order (`["extract", "survey"]`, `["build", "merge", "shape"]`). Derived `Ord` on the enums is intentional because variants are declared in kebab-alphabetical wire order.

## Adapter execution mode

Every adapter manifest declares a closed `execution` enum, `required` at the top level of both per-axis schemas. The loader rejects a manifest that omits the field with `adapter-execution-mode-required` rather than defaulting silently (`check_execution` in `crates/workflow/src/adapter/core.rs`; exit 2).

Source adapters are **agent-only**: `source.schema.json` enumerates `execution: ["agent"]` (see [§"Extraction is agent-only — no cache, no fingerprints"](#extraction-is-agent-only--no-cache-no-fingerprints)). Target manifests may declare `agent` (brief run by an agent, two-phase prepare/finalize dispatch, `*.execution.agent` journal event per invocation) or `tool` (target-axis only: `build` / `merge` dispatch through a declared WASI tool or built-in deterministic Rust path, single-phase). All eight first-party manifests ship `execution: agent`; no first-party target owns a build tool yet, so the target `tool` branch is wired and schema-valid but unexercised. Refer to workflow §"Adapter implementation shape".

## Source operations

`specify source survey <source> [--plan <name>] [--phase prepare|finalize]` and `specify source extract <source> <lead> --slice <slice> [--phase prepare|finalize]` are the CLI-owned source adapter operations; the operational contract — resolution via `plan.yaml.sources.<key>`, the two-phase agent handoff, the handoff envelope fields, and the four-root sandbox — is pinned in [workflow.md §"Source adapter contract"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#source-adapter-contract) and [§"Sandboxing"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#sandboxing). The standing decisions:

- **Validate-before-visible.** An invalid lead set leaves `discovery.md` untouched; a failed Evidence validation leaves the slice in `refining`.
- **`discovery.md` stores raw, unmerged, per-source leads.** The runner stamps `source` from the surveyed source (attribution is CLI-owned). A re-survey is a per-source fold by `(source, lead)`, never a cross-source collapse — unification is deferred to plan time, so the same `lead` may legally appear under different source keys and alias-collision scoping is per `source`.
- **`$PROJECT_DIR` is not visible to the adapter.** Lifecycle state stays off-limits; the scratch lane is recreated empty at `prepare` time so a stale artifact from a prior run can never be finalized as this run's output.
- **The CLI never blocks on agent work.** `prepare` returns after printing the handoff envelope; `finalize` validates, persists, and journals the completion event.
- **Shared prep seam.** Adapter resolution, brief-directory resolution, sandbox layout, and `evidence/` scaffolding live in one helper (`src/runtime/commands/source/prep.rs`) shared by the workflow-free `specify source preview` and the workflow-integrated runners — none of it is re-implemented per verb.
- **Value-binding envelope.** Value-bound sources (`intent`) get no `$SOURCE_DIR` preopen and carry `value-inline`; path bindings carry `source-path`.

## Lead reconciliation

`specify plan propose` wraps agent-led cross-source lead reconciliation in a CLI-owned projection kernel (kernel in `crates/workflow/src/change/plan/core/propose.rs`). The two mutually-exclusive modes (`--dry-run` read-only request envelope; `--from <response.json>` the only slice writer) are pinned in [workflow.md §"Plan-time reconciliation"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#plan-time-reconciliation). The standing decisions:

- **Replaceable gate.** `--from` replaces slices only while the plan is replaceable (`lifecycle: pending` AND every entry `pending`; `plan-reconcile-plan-not-replaceable` otherwise). Re-propose wholesale-replaces all slices — a fresh projection, not a merge — discarding prior per-slice operator edits.
- **Coverage invariant, no kernel grouping.** The kernel carries no `scope` noun. It enforces total lead coverage (every surveyed `(source, lead)` referenced by at least one slice) plus at most one lead per source per slice. A lead may appear in more than one slice — fan-out is multiple ordinary slices joined by `depends-on`, and same-project multi-homing of a cross-cutting lead is equally legal (no `depends-on` implied). Same-source fusion is rejected on purpose: each surveyed lead is the source adapter's own sizing judgment, so merging two leads from one source would override that sizing; the operator owns same-source re-sizing at Gate 1 via `specify plan amend --sources`. The at-most-one-lead-per-source invariant is enforced at every writer, not just propose: `Plan::validate` carries the `duplicate-source-key` finding (folded into the validate-and-rollback gates inside `Plan::create` / `Plan::amend`), and the `plan amend --add-source` path re-gates via `reject_duplicate_source_keys` — a duplicate key would otherwise silently overwrite `evidence/<source>.yaml` at refine time. The kernel validates shape only — it never auto-merges, clusters, or forbids cross-source splits.
- **Explicit slice names.** Every response slice carries an explicit kebab-case `name` written verbatim; `depends-on` resolves against those names (cycles fail). Name uniqueness is the sole duplicate gate.
- **Project binding.** The agent binds each slice's `project` from the request's `projects[]`; an omitted `project` auto-binds only when exactly one project exists. The target adapter is **not** written to `plan.yaml` (see [§"Target adapter suffix policy"](#target-adapter-suffix-policy)).
- **Closed validation vocabulary.** `plan-reconcile-empty-catalog`, `-lead-orphan`, `-partition`, `-slice-source-collision`, `-slice-name-invalid`, `-slice-name-collision`, `-depends-on-cycle`, `-project-binding-required`, `-project-orphan`, `-plan-not-replaceable`, plus `plan-propose-mode-required` — all `Error::Validation` outcomes (exit 2), not new enum arms.
- **Single-event journal.** One `plan.reconcile.completed` fires only after the `plan.yaml` write commits. The `/spec:plan` skill never calls `specify journal emit` for reconciliation.
- **Split on doubt.** Matching rides on per-source `synopsis` headlines alone, so the synopsis carries a contentfulness expectation (taught in survey briefs; surfaced as the non-blocking `discovery-lead-synopsis-thin` advisory). The error-cost asymmetry is stated in the propose brief: an over-merge is expensive and downstream-poisoning, an over-split is cheap and Gate-1-reversible — so a weakly-supported cross-source match stays as separate slices with the candidate pairing noted in `change.md` under `## Tentative merges`.
- **Deferred (rejected).** Kernel-side token-intersection auto-merge (shared slugs are unattested), kernel-side advisory clustering (would need per-lead `blocking-keys[]` survey metadata), and per-lead target-axis hints (`target` stays kernel-derived). Grouping uncertainty is the agent's to express through `change.md` prose, not a survey input signal.

## Target build envelope

`specify slice build <slice> [--phase prepare|finalize]` owns the per-slice build envelopes — the symmetric target-side twin of the source runners: the CLI owns request assembly, report validation, the `target-build-*` aborts, the `slice.build.*` events, and the `built` transition gate; the bound target's `build` brief owns only code generation. The envelope shapes, two-phase flow, and what the request deliberately omits (`target`, `execution`, brief paths, `model.yaml`) are pinned in [workflow.md §"Target adapter contract"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#target-adapter-contract). The standing decisions:

- **Closed validation vocabulary.** The five pinned aborts — `target-build-request-schema`, `target-build-report-schema`, `target-build-success-with-blocking-finding`, `target-build-input-missing`, `target-build-output-missing` — are `Error::Validation` outcomes (exit 2), not new enum arms. The handler also raises adjacent operational diagnostics (`target-build-report-missing`, `-report-slice-mismatch`, `-failed`, `-tool-unsupported`, `-brief-missing`).
- **Cross-slice dependency is plan-level ordering** (`depends-on` + `specify plan next`), not envelope plumbing — there is no per-request cross-slice channel.
- **No merge envelope (v1).** `specify slice merge` stays the merge writer; `slice.merge.*` fire on its validator outcome, and the durable record stays `slice.archive.created`. A future merge-findings need reuses the build-report shape as `build/merge-report.yaml` rather than authoring a second schema.
- **Build outputs are not cached** in either execution mode; generated code is reproduced by re-running the build.
- **Acceptance proof.** One end-to-end fixture proves fan-in twice and fan-out once together: [`tests/plan/end_to_end.rs`](./tests/plan/end_to_end.rs) over `tests/fixtures/fan-in-fan-out/` asserts envelope/ordering/determinism. The separate generated-output-correctness release gate (replay/golden suites plus `cargo check` / `cargo test` for generated crates) is a manual/CI acceptance step, not part of the deterministic test.

## Workspace terminology

The word **workspace** overloads three related concepts. Use them verbatim in operator-facing prose:

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workspace**      | Registry-only platform repo: `workspace: true` in `project.yaml`, `registry.yaml`, plan artifacts at the repo root |
| **Workspace slot** | Materialised peer at `workspace/<project>/`                                                                        |
| **Workspace sync** | `specify workspace sync` — materialise slots and regenerate `topology.lock`                                        |

`/spec:init workspace` and `specify init --workspace` scaffold a workspace; init chains an initial workspace sync before returning.

## Plan-root override: global `--plan-dir` (env `SPECIFY_PLAN_DIR`)

Workspace routing runs phase work inside a materialised slot while `plan.yaml` / `change.md` / `discovery.md` stay at the initiating workspace — by design no slot grows its own plan, and symlinked slots physically live outside the workspace tree so upward path-walking cannot find it. The bridge is an **explicit pass-through from the executor**, which already knows the workspace root: the global `--plan-dir <PATH>` flag (env `SPECIFY_PLAN_DIR`) names the directory holding the governing plan artifacts.

- **One seam.** `Ctx::layout()` applies the override via `Layout::with_plan_dir`; only `plan_path()`, `change_brief_path()`, and `discovery_path()` move. Every `.specify/`-anchored path (slices, journal, scratch, cache, archive) stays on the project (slot) root — observability and slice state remain project-local.
- **Relative source bindings follow the plan.** `plan.yaml.sources.<key>.path` relative bindings are authored against the plan's home, so `resolve_source_path` joins them onto the plan root, not the slot.
- **Merge keeps its writer monopoly.** With the override, slot-side `specify slice merge` stamps per-entry `done` in the workspace plan — the "sole writer of `done`" contract holds in workspace mode without a second stamping verb at the workspace.
- **No back-pointer, no discovery.** The CLI never guesses: an override naming a plan-less directory fails with the same typed errors (e.g. `slice-synthesize-plan-missing`), whose message cites the overridden path. Adapter resolution is untouched — slot-side source adapters resolve project-locally (vendored tree or manifest cache) per §"Adapter loader axis routing".

## Slot adapter provisioning via workspace sync

Slots carry no plan and no adapters by design, yet slot-side phase work must resolve the adapters the workspace's `plan.yaml.sources` bind. The loader stays exactly as recorded (§"Adapter loader axis routing": resolution is project-local only); `specify workspace sync` provisions the probe location the loader already consults — it mirrors the workspace's adapter set (both axes, vendored tree and manifest-cache mirror alike, `tools.yaml` sidecars included) into each synced slot's out-of-tree `<slot-cache>/manifests/{sources,targets}/`. Mirroring is unconditional over the workspace adapter set: no plan parsing in sync, and the cache is out-of-tree so slots carry no repo residue. Implementation: `crates/workflow/src/registry/workspace/mirror.rs`.

- **Per-name delete-then-copy, no GC of foreign names.** Each workspace-owned name is removed and re-copied per sync, so re-sync refreshes. Names the workspace does not own are never pruned — the slot cache has a second legitimate writer (`specify init` caches greenfield adapter seeds), and a per-axis wipe could delete an adapter only the slot has. A name present at the workspace in both probe locations copies from the manifest cache, matching the loader's probe order.
- **Slot-vendored names are skipped at mirror time, cross-axis.** The loader probes the cache *before* the vendored tree, so "the slot's own copy wins" cannot come from probe order — the mirror skips any name the slot vendors under `adapters/{sources,targets}/<name>/` on either axis. The same-axis skip keeps the slot copy winning resolution; the opposite-axis skip means the mirror can never manufacture an `adapter-name-axis-collision` in a previously healthy slot.
- **Local symlink slots are mirrored too** — unlike the contracts distribution, which skips them — because the adapter gap is slot-side resolution regardless of slot backing, and the write lands only under the peer's out-of-tree per-project cache. A `url: .` self-slot is skipped: mirroring the workspace onto itself would remove-then-copy the cache from itself. Peers without `.specify/` are skipped, never scaffolded.

The rejected alternative — a resolve-time plan-root fallback — shipped mid-run and was removed (`204e3867`): it contradicted the loader contract, keyed on the `adapter-not-found` string discriminant, and covered only the source axis. Staleness keeps its existing answer everywhere in workspace mode: re-run sync (the per-slice sync in the execute loop makes that automatic).

## Registry projection and topology cache

Give every fact one writer; derive everything else. A project's *authored intent* — target `adapter` and `description` — lives only in its `.specify/project.yaml`. Its *routing identity* is **derived, not authored**: a deterministic structural projection of the project's own baseline. There are no `capabilities` / `keywords` facets — a derived routing identity needs no second writer duplicating what the baseline already states. `registry.yaml` carries membership + location, cross-project `contracts` wiring, and an optional `adapter` used solely as a greenfield scaffold seed.

- **Derived identity cache.** Workspace plan-time topology is projected through a committed `.specify/topology.lock` (`TopologyLock` in `crates/workflow/src/registry/topology.rs`), regenerated by `workspace sync` from each slot's `project.yaml` plus the deterministic baseline projection (`surface[]` = per-domain spec titles capped at `SURFACE_TITLE_CAP = 8`; `recent[]` = last `RECENT_TAIL = 10` `slice.archive.created` summaries). The projection is structural and byte-stable, never an LLM summary, so the committed lock verifies by regenerate-and-compare; it is machine-written write-if-changed and operators never hand-edit it. `TopologyProject` does `deny_unknown_fields`, so a pre-upgrade lock fails to load until `workspace sync` rewrites it — the ordinary machine-rewrite fix.
- **Read path.** `workspace_topology` builds `ProjectRef[]` from `topology.lock`, not `registry.yaml`; an absent cache fails `topology-cache-missing`. Empty `surface` / `recent` stay off the wire, so a greenfield project degrades cleanly to `description` only. A single regular project reads `project.yaml` plus its own projection live (`regular_topology`).
- **Staleness, not synchronisation.** `specify plan validate` emits `topology-cache-stale` (warning) on divergence — a regenerate-and-compare check whose fix is `workspace sync`. There is no top-down overwrite of `project.yaml` and no `--check` flag; CI uses the exit-2 gate of `plan validate`. Both topology codes are plan-doctor findings on exit 2.

## Tool-owned schemas

Every JSON Schema is owned by the repo of the WASI tool (or the CLI) that runs it. Plugin briefs reference schemas exclusively by their canonical `$id` URL and never contain schema bodies. The three Vectis runtime schemas live solely with the vectis extension crate in `augentic/specify-adapters` (`adapters/targets/vectis/extension/embedded/`), with no byte-identity duplication or manual mirroring obligation; this repo no longer carries any vectis schema body.

## `specify tool schema` verb

`specify tool schema <tool> <name>` delegates to the tool's `schema <name>` subcommand via the existing `tool::run` path and passes through the guest's exit code: `0` when the schema is emitted, `2` for an unknown tool or schema name. Host side at `src/runtime/commands/tool/schema.rs`; guest side per tool.

## Schema `$id` convention

Tool-owned schemas use a stable `$id` of the form `https://schemas.specify.dev/<tool>/<name>.schema.json`. The URL is a logical identifier; it does not need to resolve to a hosted copy. CLI-owned framework schemas use `https://schemas.specify.dev/specify/<path>`. The `links.brief-schema-link-resolve` predicate enforces that every `schemas.specify.dev` URL cited in adapter briefs resolves to a known schema.

## `specify source preview`

`specify source preview <adapter> --source <path> [--lead <id>...] [--out <path>]` is a workflow-free verb: it resolves the source adapter, validates `--source`, scaffolds `${out}/evidence/`, and emits a summary. No `.specify/` writes, no journal events; it uses `dispatch` (not `scoped`) so no `.specify/` directory is required. Implementation at `src/runtime/commands/source/preview.rs`.

## Component catalog

An operator-curated file at `.specify/design-system/components.yaml` declares shared UI components (`status: confirmed | rejected`); schema CLI-owned at `schemas/design-system/components.schema.json`, domain type `ComponentsCatalog` in `crates/workflow/src/design_system.rs`. The catalog is opt-in — projects without the file work exactly as before. `specify slice validate` enforces `slice-catalog-drift`: every Evidence claim carrying `component: <slug>` must resolve to a confirmed catalog entry. `notes.candidate_component` annotations are informational-only and never trigger drift.

## Vectis catalog consumer

The Vectis target's `build` brief reads the component catalog and factors shared component code per confirmed entry per in-scope shell tree (brief additions in the plugin repo). The Vectis WASI tool's `validate composition` mode enforces catalog cross-references: every `component: <slug>` in `composition.yaml` must resolve to a confirmed entry (missing or rejected = error); an unreferenced confirmed entry is a warning. When the catalog is absent, the check is silently skipped.

## Standards layer split into `specify-standards` and `specify-schema`

The standards surface (rules parser / resolver, `WorkspaceModel`, indexer, deterministic hint interpreter, `specify lint` runner) lives in `specify-standards`, a **sibling** of `specify-workflow` rather than a module inside it. `specify-schema` is the shared leaf owning every embedded JSON Schema constant plus the `jsonschema` plumbing, so workflow and standards consume schemas from one place.

Dependency direction is the decision: `specify-standards` does **not** depend on `specify-workflow`, and `specify-workflow` does **not** depend on `specify-standards`. The sibling shape makes "no lifecycle authority in review" a type-system invariant — review code cannot reach slice or plan transitions because the workflow types are not visible. The `kind: tool` lint evaluator is wired through a `ToolRunner` trait at the CLI boundary, not a `specify-tool` dependency. The neutral diagnostic substrate lives one layer further down in `specify-diagnostics` (see [§"Drained `Error::Validation` and the `Diagnostic` substrate"](#drained-errorvalidation-and-the-diagnostic-substrate)), so `specify-workflow` and the `specify_model::validate` registry mint diagnostics without depending on anything named `lint`. The root binary wires the halves together at the dispatcher boundary; they never call each other directly. See [architecture.md §"Standards layer vs workflow layer"](./docs/standards/architecture.md#standards-layer-vs-workflow-layer).

## Drained `Error::Validation` and the `Diagnostic` substrate

Every check surface — `specify lint`, `specify lint framework`, `specify slice validate`, plan validation, library validators — speaks one currency: `Diagnostic` / `DiagnosticReport`, housed in the `specify-diagnostics` leaf (depends only on `specify-{error,schema,digest}`; must never depend on standards, model, or workflow so it stays importable by every producer).

**Lint and validate stay conceptually distinct surfaces.** They share the substrate, not the authority: **validate** gates a lifecycle transition — workflow-owned, non-negotiable, non-silenceable (ignore directives are off). **lint** is standards/policy compliance — codex-owned, lifecycle-neutral (may block CI, never transitions a slice), silenceable with an in-source rationale. Convergence applies to the data type, fingerprint, validator, renderer, and blocking predicate — never to the concepts or their gate policies. The litmus test: `validate` (or any non-lint producer) must not depend on a crate or module named `lint`.

**Two orthogonal axes** keep the concepts queryable on the one type: `source` (provenance: `deterministic | model-assisted | hybrid | human | tool`) and `kind` (nature: `violation` vs `review` — a deterministically-raised request for judgment; the former `Deferred` classification and `lint-mode: model-assisted` rules both surface as `kind: review`, `source: deterministic`).

**Uniform blocking predicate, per-surface application.** `blocking()` returns true iff `kind == violation && status == open && severity ∈ {critical, important}`. `kind == review` never blocks anywhere. Each surface applies the same predicate, differing only in whether ignore directives run first (lint: yes; validate: no).

**`Error::Validation` is payload-free.** `Error::Validation { code, detail }`; `variant_str()` returns the carried `code`, so the top-level wire `error` is the specific discriminant rather than a generic `"validation"`. Handlers own rendering: a gate failure renders the full `DiagnosticReport` on **stdout**, then returns the payload-free error purely to carry exit 2 and the discriminant on stderr. Single operational errors that are not findings take the same shape via `Error::validation_failed(code, detail)` but render no report.

**Widened `ruleId` namespace.** The diagnostic `ruleId` pattern accepts both the closed codex family (`UNI-`/`CORE-`/… `-NNN`) and the runtime-validation discriminant form (dotted/kebab lowercase), so workflow and validate producers stamp their invariant ids onto the same finding shape the codex engine uses.

## Composition validation is vectis-tool-owned

The `specify_model::validate` registry carries no `composition` rule namespace. The registry once registered four `composition.*` rules, but `validate_slice`'s canonical artifact set never fed them — they were dead at the runner while their unit tests asserted the registry entry existed (false confidence). Rather than wiring `composition.yaml` into `CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS`, the namespace was deleted: deep composition validation (schema, structural identity, token/asset refs, catalog cross-references) is owned by the vectis WASI tool's `validate composition` mode, and a shallow host-side duplicate would only drift from it. The host keeps exactly one composition touchpoint: `cross.composition-maps-to-consistent`, which checks `maps_to` well-formedness against the slice's specs. `Artifact::Composition` survives in `specify-diagnostics` — the vectis tool and build wire still stamp findings with it.

## Codex-rule schema: one source of truth

The rules parser consumes the canonical rule schema directly via `specify_schema::RULE_JSON_SCHEMA` (paired with the typed `Rule` DTO). One source of truth means no vendored copy and no drift check: the canonical schema lives at `schemas/rules/rule.schema.json` and is embedded through `specify-schema` like every other schema.

## Lint finding status, disposition, and exit

`Diagnostic.status` is a closed kebab-case enum. The fingerprint algorithm excludes both `status` and `disposition`, so demoting a finding from `open` to `ignored` (or `false-positive`) never changes its identity.

| Value            | Set by            | Meaning                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `open`           | scanner (default) | Freshly emitted finding before post-passes run. The only value that contributes to the `specify lint` exit-code decision by default. |
| `ignored`        | directive pass    | An in-source `specify-ignore` directive matched the finding's `(path, line, rule-id)`. Carries `disposition.directive`.              |
| `false-positive` | directive pass    | A directive matched and the rationale was prefixed `false-positive:`. Reported separately in dashboards.                             |
| `fixed`          | reserved          | Reserved for the cross-run baseline diff verb. No producer in v1.                                                                    |
| `accepted`       | reserved          | Reserved for explicit operator acceptance via the baseline file. No producer in v1.                                                  |

`disposition` is an optional sibling object (`{ source, directive?, since? }`), populated only when `status != open`; `disposition.source` is a closed enum whose only v1 value is `directive` — a future baseline producer adds `baseline` additively.

`specify lint project` resolves the process exit with **status-aware severity**: exit `2` only when a finding has `status: open` AND `severity ∈ {critical, important}`. The synthetic findings for malformed (`UNI-022`) and orphan (`UNI-023`) directives default to `status: open` (the shared codex ships both at `important`). **Graceful degradation:** when the codex resolver does not produce `UNI-022`/`UNI-023` — a consumer without the shared codex tree — synthetic emission silently skips while status stamping continues; the fix is codex distribution (see [§"Shared codex distribution"](#shared-codex-distribution)). The operator-facing directive grammar lives in the parent repo's [`docs/reference/ignore-directives.md`](https://github.com/augentic/specify/blob/main/docs/reference/ignore-directives.md).

## Shared codex distribution

Consumer projects resolve shared `UNI-*` rules without a co-located framework checkout or a manual `--rules-root` (RM-07). The shared codex ships beside the target adapter in its source repo (`adapters/shared/rules/{universal,core}/`); `specify init` and `specify rules sync` mirror it into the out-of-tree `<project-cache>/codex/`, **pinned to the same adapter source/ref**.

- **Probe order** (`probe_rules_root` in `crates/standards/src/rules/resolve.rs`): explicit `--rules-root` → monorepo `adapters/shared/rules/universal/` → codex cache → `rules-root-required`. The cache rung is a derived root, so the fallback overlay stays skipped, exactly like the monorepo case; both `specify lint` and `specify rules export` honour it.
- **Distribution.** `cache_codex` / `sync_codex` walk up from the resolved adapter `source_dir` to the nearest ancestor carrying the `universal/` pack and copy it (plus `core/` under `--include-framework`); git sources fetch in the same sparse checkout as the adapter. **Fail-soft:** a source tree without the pack leaves the cache empty and the consumer falls back to `--rules-root`.
- **Provenance.** `CodexMeta` (`codex-meta.yaml`) records the pinned source, `include_framework`, and `fetched_at`. Audit-only; the resolver never reads it.
- **Distribution vs evaluation are independent.** `--include-framework` controls what lands in the cache; the resolver's `include_core` controls whether `CORE-*` rules are evaluated/exported. Consumer projects default to neither.

## Single slice-model artifact

- **One artifact.** A synthesized slice persists exactly one structured file, `model.yaml`, with provenance inline (`requirements[].claims[]` carrying `winner`, plus `resolution`). There is no on-disk `provenance.yaml`.
- **Provenance is a projection.** `ProvenanceIndex` (`crates/workflow/src/slice/provenance.rs`) is computed from `model.yaml` and emitted on demand by `specify slice provenance`; it is never loaded from disk. There is no file-drift gate (a projection cannot drift from its source); spec-vs-model staleness and `(source, id)` orphan checks apply. There is no `slice.provenance.written` journal kind.
- **One schema.** `SLICE_MODEL_JSON_SCHEMA` validates both the agent's synthesis-response `model` and the persisted file; kernel-owned fields are optional, re-derived, and ignored if supplied (normalize, never reject), so `DRAFT_MODEL_JSON_SCHEMA` and the `slice-synthesize-kernel-field-usurped` abort both retire.

## Projection over persistence

Derived state is projected on demand from the journal plus committed artifacts — or pinned to its single authored home by lint — never persisted as a second hand-maintained copy. A projection cannot drift from its source; a persisted copy drifts the moment the source moves.

- **The journal is the anchor.** `.specify/journal.jsonl` ([§"Journal event names"](#journal-event-names)) plus the committed artifacts (`plan.yaml`, slice `metadata.yaml`, the specs baseline) are the only stores; everything downstream is recomputed per invocation.
- **Live projections.** Provenance ([§"Single slice-model artifact"](#single-slice-model-artifact) — "Provenance is a projection") and `specify plan status`, which projects plan entries + the candidate slice's lifecycle + the journal tail into a deterministic `next-action` with stop classification read from the `slice.synthesize.failed` / `slice.build.failed` / `slice.merge.failed` terminals, writing nothing and emitting no event. RM-15's re-entry fields extend the same body rather than persisting a status file.
- **One read surface.** `specify journal show [--filter <event-id-prefix>] [--limit N]` is the read verb over the journal; eval probes and any future dashboard consume it instead of bespoke `jq` bridges over the JSONL.
- **Lint-pinned homes.** Where derived prose must exist as a copy (the eval catalog's status table), a framework rule pins it to its authored home (CORE-056 catalog↔runs agreement) so divergence is a lint finding, not a review discovery. (The `content-digest-eq` digest-pinning kind retired with its last rule consumers — restatements became links.)

## Architecture seam hardening

One hardening move per seam, each carried by its own standing decision: the machine-checked cross-repo contract is `specify contract dump` plus the `cli-contract` lint kind (R1); control flow keeps migrating into CLI verbs — the `specify plan status` next-action projection, and both the acquisition and the read-side probe of the driver lock in `crates/workflow/src/plan_lock.rs` (R2): `specify plan lock -- <cmd>` is the `flock(1)`-style command-wrapper that takes the lock for the spawned child's lifetime (so lock handling is cross-platform and Python/`flock(1)`/`zsystem`-free), and the plan-state-writing verbs `require_held`; status surfaces are projections per [§"Projection over persistence"](#projection-over-persistence), with `specify journal show` as the read verb (R3); vocabulary restatements became links or lint-pinned homes (R5). The explicit anti-recommendation stands: `specify-workflow` is not split.

## Composition accumulation and component inference

The landed split: deterministic component *identity* (structural fingerprint over the normalized skeleton) and stable, non-clobbering name *binding* live in the CLI (`specify catalog infer`); component *identification and naming* are model judgement in the Vectis build brief. The operator-curated catalog ([§"Component catalog"](#component-catalog)) and the Vectis tool's composition cross-reference check ([§"Vectis catalog consumer"](#vectis-catalog-consumer)) carry the durable contract; the hard-coded slug-derivation ontology was deleted, not extended.

## Authority: document-level plus one override (v1)

v1 resolves authority at document level (`intent` > `documentation` > `behaviour`) with a single override surface: the per-slice `authority-override` on `plan.yaml`, keyed by claim kind. The per-Evidence `authority-overrides` field and per-kind class-lifting are removed for v1 and deferred to a future RFC; the `AuthorityOverrides` type is deleted accordingly, while the closed `AuthorityClass` / `ClaimKind` enums stay.

## Slice synthesis engine

The durable contract for `specify slice synthesize`, its projection kernel, and the schema/event additions. Complements [§"Single slice-model artifact"](#single-slice-model-artifact) and [§"Authority: document-level plus one override (v1)"](#authority-document-level-plus-one-override-v1). The two-phase command surface (`--dry-run` inputs envelope / `--from` sole writer) and the kernel-ownership split (agent authors claims + prose; kernel re-derives ids, status, winners, sources, provenance) are pinned in [workflow.md §"Slice synthesis"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#slice-synthesis). The standing decisions:

- **Two-phase, agent-dispatched.** Mirrors `plan propose`: exactly one of the two modes is required (`slice-synthesize-mode-required`); there is no WASI tool path and no closed *request* wire shape. Authority is resolved by the kernel **after** the response returns, never shipped in the inputs envelope.
- **Authority kernel.** Resolution order per `(source, kind)`: per-slice override → document `authority` → default class order; a tie at the top class is a `conflict`; mixed-kind requirements resolve each claim independently and pick the strictly-greatest effective class. Pure modules under `crates/workflow/src/slice/synthesis/` (`authority.rs`, `project.rs`, `render.rs`, `wire.rs`).
- **Earned-core schema trim.** `model.schema.json` is trimmed to `required: [requirements, tasks]` — the deferred `domain` / `apis` / `configuration` / `technical-logic` / `observability` sub-trees and their id grammars, `value` / `path` on claims, and `resolution` / `resolution-trace` are dropped until earned. `synthesis.schema.json` `$ref`s the model schema by relative URI; the two compile together through a `jsonschema::Registry` pinning `MODEL_SCHEMA_URL`. The `validate_synthesis_json` gate runs on raw bytes before structural deserialize (`synthesis-schema`, exit 2).
- **`to_provenance_index` recompute.** With `value` / `path` / `resolution` gone from the model, the projection recomputes `resolution` via the authority kernel and reads each claim's `value` / `path` from on-disk Evidence keyed by `(source, id)`.
- **Drift validators.** `specify slice validate` emits seven blocking typed-model findings (exit 2) — `slice-model-schema`, `slice-spec-provenance-stale`, `slice-model-target-drift`, `slice-model-source-orphan`, `slice-model-cross-ref-orphan`, `slice-model-claim-kind-mismatch`, `slice-model-id-grammar` — as `Diagnostic` findings on the `DiagnosticReport` surface (meanings tabulated in [workflow.md §"Slice synthesis"](./docs/standards/workflow.md#slice-synthesis)).
- **Journal events.** The `slice.synthesize.{started|agent|completed|failed}` lifecycle quartet is distinct from the per-requirement `slice.synthesis.{conflict,divergence,unknown}` tag events. See [§"Journal event names"](#journal-event-names).

## `domain` replaces `unit` as the spec.md boundary noun

The slice-sized spec grouping — the `specs/<slug>/spec.md` directory segment, the `proposal.md` section heading, and the owning key on each model requirement — is named **domain**, not *unit*. *Unit* was target-neutral but colourless and collided with "unit test" prose; *domain* survives all three first-party targets (Omnia crate/service surface, Vectis business feature, contracts API domain) and was already latent in the contracts shape brief ("API domain slug"). The rename was a hard cut with no migrator (pre-1.0, no downstream projects): the wire keys (`synthesis.schema.json` / `model.schema.json` `domain`, `topology-lock.schema.json` / `proposal.schema.json` `surface[].domain`), the `## Domains` proposal heading, and the validate rule ids (`proposal.domains-listed`, `cross.proposal-domains-have-specs`) all renamed in place with no compatibility aliases. Note the name proximity to the *deferred* top-level `domain` sub-tree in the earned-core schema trim (§"Slice synthesis engine"): the requirement-level `domain` key is the spec grouping; the deferred sub-tree, if ever earned, must pick a non-colliding name.

## History via git plus an outcome ledger

Revises the archive posture. The durable record of merged work is git history of the committed `.specify/specs/` baseline plus an append-only outcome ledger: a `slice.archive.created` journal event (payload: slice, touched-specs, outcome summary, merge SHA) emitted from the merge path. The archived slice folder under `.specify/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<slice>/` becomes a prunable convenience cache governed by `specify archive prune` (retention policy mirroring the tool-cache GC), not the system of record. `.specify/specs/` stays committable (init gitignores only `.specify/scratch/` and the top-level `workspace/`; the cache is out-of-tree, so there is nothing in-tree to ignore).

## Bootstrap and upgrade lifecycle

The standing record for the two CLI-owned bootstrap concerns — stale binary and plugin-cache drift. The `/spec:init` skill stays the orchestrator; each deterministic action is its own CLI verb (`upgrade`, `plugins {doctor,refresh}`; handlers under `src/runtime/commands/`, domain logic under `crates/workflow/src/`).

- **No migration framework, pre-1.0.** There are no compatibility shims, no versioned parsing, and no `specify migrate` verb: a major version cut means re-init (`specify init --upgrade` over an existing project bumps the pin; anything deeper is a fresh `specify init`). A pin older than the binary loads normally; only a pin *newer* than the binary refuses (`Error::CliTooOld`, exit 3). If a migration story is ever warranted post-1.0, it gets its own decision here first.
- **CLI owns the deterministic actions; skills orchestrate intent and consent only.** Every mutating action requires `--yes` (or interactive confirmation); `--dry-run` previews without writing; the read-only probe (`plugins doctor`) never mutates.
- **Channel detection.** `InstallChannel::detect()` classifies the running binary's path into `cargo | brew | binary | unknown` (the last a structured diagnostic with manual-upgrade guidance). The latest-release probe order is `SPECIFY_RELEASE_TAG` override → `gh release view` → unauthenticated GitHub API; a probe failure is a **warning**, not an error.
- **Plugin-cache sha derivation.** `plugins doctor` scans `$CURSOR_HOME/plugins/cache/` against the discovered marketplace; the expected sha for relative-path sources is `git rev-parse HEAD` of the marketplace repo, shared by every plugin. An unresolvable expected sha degrades to `present` / `missing` rather than asserting unprovable drift. The closed status set is `ok | drifted | present | missing | extra`; `doctor` never exits non-zero on drift (drift is a finding), only on FS/parse failure. `plugins refresh` deletes the cache directory, journals `plugins.refreshed`, and never restarts Cursor or touches IDE state.
- **Two bootstrap journal events** — `cli.upgraded`, `plugins.refreshed` (see [§"Journal event names"](#journal-event-names)). `--dry-run` writes nothing and fires no event.
- **Binary-channel self-replace deferred.** The `cargo` and `brew` executors are fully wired; the `binary`-channel in-process self-replace (download → verify checksum sidecar → atomic swap) is deferred until the release pipeline's archive/checksum naming contract lands. Today the `binary` channel emits a planned-action plus structured manual-upgrade guidance.
